            <h2>Nigeria</h2>
            <p>Nigeria is located on the west coast of Africa and is the most populous black country in the world,
                bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Benin and Cameroon. Nigeria covers 356,668 sq miles
                (923,7770 sq kilometers).
                It is about the same size as California, Nevada and Utah combined.Nigeria is covered by three types of
                vegetation:forests (where there is significant tree cover), savannahs (insignificant tree cover, with
                grasses and flowers
                located between trees), and montane land (least common and mainly found in the mountains near the
                Cameroon border). Both the forest zone and the savannah zone are divided into three parts.</p>
